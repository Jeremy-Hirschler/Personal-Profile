            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Jeremy. A little background about me - I received my Bachelor of Science
                in Chemical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University in 2016. Since then, I have
                held various analytical scientist positions performing benchwork. Now, however, I am
                looking for a position that doesn't involve running around the lab all day! I had taken a few
                programming classes online but never considered the possibility of pivoting into
                a software developer role until now! I am currently
                working through a programming bootcamp which focuses on the MERN stack and loving every minute of it.
                At this point, I am looking
                to pivot into a more tech-based role such as software engineering, and  may plan to return
                to school to get a Master's degree in Data Science or Bioinformatics. Right now, however,
                I am looking to get into the tech field so I can start learning as much as possible! This site was
                made using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I've been learning throughout my bootcamp, and I am
                very exciting to start putting it into practice!
            </p>
